[Atomic Habits](./Readings/Atomic Habits)


Janine --
	Rituals 
		mental health
		power of symbols -- everything is meaningless
		CBT/psychology, power to change your mind
		placebo magic -- if you're drawn to the occult/magic, it makes sense 
		smashing the rose wishing for telekinesis -- wishing for power, motivation
			me and bubbles
		believing that you can attain power makes you powerful -- gets buried under what society tells you
		difference between belief and alief
			certainty of truth
			know that something isn't true, but you can immerse yourself and have it impact your behavior (suspension of disbelief) (tetralemma)
		the paradox of placebo -- it works even though it doesn't work
		religion -- the power of community (maybe you don't need the dogma or the shame to get the benefit)
		helps you step outside the structure of your life (a costume you can put on) -- the power of reinvention
		Jungian archetypes as pantheon (believing in the muse brings the muse into your life) -- giving the symbol power is reflected back to you (knight)
		imagination and play is for kids or crazy people
		narrative therapy -- create the league of supporting people around you who can believe in your new story and therefore give that symbol power 
		co-creation of reality -- sharing ideas (janine virus is jungian strain mixed with xyz strain, then my placebo magic from janine is the variant)
		all these things are trying to make sense of the world (new ways of making sense vs the old bad ways like religion)

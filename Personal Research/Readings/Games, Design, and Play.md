# Games, Design, and Play
### Colleen Macklin and John Sharp


## Preface
**Game design** is the practice of conceiving of and creating the way a game works, including the core actions, themes, and most importantly, the gameâ€™s play experience. Game design requires an understanding of different kinds of games, how they work, and the processes game designers use to create them. **Game development**, on the other hand, encompasses the creation of the game, including game design, programming, art production, writing, sound design, level design, producing, testing, marketing, business development, and more.

Play over product -- "play focused, not product oriented"

## Chapter 1
Games are processes that produce play when interacted with, mechanisms for generating play. 

**Systems dynamics** -- considering how the elements of a game come together to create different dynamics. Like a car, same combination of elements, but different drivers (inputs) produce different outputs (traffic, parallel parking, racing). Systems take inputs and generate different kinds of outputs.

Games are systems that dynamically generate play. (experiences and dynamics)

Games are works created to express, convey, and provide experiences. Closer to a poem than a pocket knife.

Design games --> produce play --> generate physical, intellectual, and emotional responses

### Basic Elements of Play Design
- Actions
	- Actions are the things players get to do while playing a game
- Rules
	- Rules define what actions players are able to do and what actions they cannot do
	- If the rules say you can't do something, you must assume you can (common sense though)
	- Though structure seems limiting on the surface, rules are where player creativity, choice, and expression are born. Restrictions are what makes the game fun. Challenge is what makes things engaging. 
		- Bicycle kick in soccer
- Goals
	- Goals define what players try to acheive while playing.
	- Surface goal of players vs ultimate goal of designers (Jackbox being about points but never about points, points are the abstraction of audience laughs).
		- Goals can be the driving reason to play (sport), or simply a catlyst for a playful experience (exquisite corpse).
	- Goals are what separate games from toys
		- Game or toy quiz
			- Kendama, or cup-and-ball
			- Hopscotch
			- Ball
			- Ball on field
			- Rubiks Cube
			- Fidget Spinner
	- Goals can be self-directed, such as in sandbox games like Minecraft or the Sims.
- Objects
	- Objects are the things players interact with during play.
- Playspace
	- The context and environment of the game.
	- Combined with objects, constitutes the physical, tangible elements of the game.
	- Should be designed to encourage and support the kind of play you want your players to have.
- Players
	- Players put the game into motion through the pursuit of the goals using actions and objects within the playspace, all governed by the game's rules.
	- Can you have a game without players? No?

Iterative Design is so important with games because of how little control the designer has over how the game will be played. Humans are messy, complicated, and dumb. It's only by methodically testing and refining that designers can acheive exactly the play experience they wish their players to have. (as opposed to a painting or song perhaps, though those would benefit from iteration too). Control is big.

**Second-order design** -- the game developers create the game, but the player is the one who decides how, when, and why to play it. In mathematics and propositional logic, first-order logic is the insertion of variables into an equation, and second-order logic emerges from the interaction of those variables. So we set up the variables (the play elements), but we have almost no control over the interactions (save through our designs). Unexpected outcomes (actions, feelings, contexts) emerge when a player plays within the dynamic system of a game. 

**Space of possibility** -- the potential experiences a game designer creates through their combination of objects, playspace, players, rules, actions, and goals. (Queers in love at the end of the world or line wobbler VS minecraft). Shifts focus of responsibility for experience -- narrow space games are usually designed for a very specific experience the designer wants you to have, while huge open-world games leave the experience up to the player (mostly). Why play design is important -- designing games doesn't produce experiences, but designing games that produce play produces experiences (or something).

**Game state** refers to a snapshot moment of a game -- where the players and objects are in the playspace, the current score, the progress towards completing the game's goal, and so on. Sequence of states will always be similar but likely never the same -- why games are such a powerful medium, they allow for endless emergent experience. (**emergent experience** defined as meaning arising from choices).

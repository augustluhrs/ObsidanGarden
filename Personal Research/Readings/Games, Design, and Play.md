# Games, Design, and Play
### Colleen Macklin and John Sharp


## Preface
**Game design** is the practice of conceiving of and creating the way a game works, including the core actions, themes, and most importantly, the gameâ€™s play experience. Game design requires an understanding of different kinds of games, how they work, and the processes game designers use to create them. **Game development**, on the other hand, encompasses the creation of the game, including game design, programming, art production, writing, sound design, level design, producing, testing, marketing, business development, and more.

Play over product -- "play focused, not product oriented"

## Chapter 1: Games, Design, and Play
Games are processes that produce play when interacted with, mechanisms for generating play. 

**Systems dynamics** -- considering how the elements of a game come together to create different dynamics. Like a car, same combination of elements, but different drivers (inputs) produce different outputs (traffic, parallel parking, racing). Systems take inputs and generate different kinds of outputs.

Games are systems that dynamically generate play. (experiences and dynamics)

Games are works created to express, convey, and provide experiences. Closer to a poem than a pocket knife.

Design games --> produce play --> generate physical, intellectual, and emotional responses

### Basic Elements of Play Design
- Actions
	- Actions are the things players get to do while playing a game
- Rules
	- Rules define what actions players are able to do and what actions they cannot do
	- If the rules say you can't do something, you must assume you can (common sense though)
	- Though structure seems limiting on the surface, rules are where player creativity, choice, and expression are born. Restrictions are what makes the game fun. Challenge is what makes things engaging. 
		- Bicycle kick in soccer
- Goals
	- Goals define what players try to acheive while playing.
	- Surface goal of players vs ultimate goal of designers (Jackbox being about points but never about points, points are the abstraction of audience laughs).
		- Goals can be the driving reason to play (sport), or simply a catlyst for a playful experience (exquisite corpse).
	- Goals are what separate games from toys
		- Game or toy quiz
			- Kendama, or cup-and-ball
			- Hopscotch
			- Ball
			- Ball on field
			- Rubiks Cube
			- Fidget Spinner
	- Goals can be self-directed, such as in sandbox games like Minecraft or the Sims.
- Objects
	- Objects are the things players interact with during play.
- Playspace
	- The context and environment of the game.
	- Combined with objects, constitutes the physical, tangible elements of the game.
	- Should be designed to encourage and support the kind of play you want your players to have.
- Players
	- Players put the game into motion through the pursuit of the goals using actions and objects within the playspace, all governed by the game's rules.
	- Can you have a game without players? No?

Iterative Design is so important with games because of how little control the designer has over how the game will be played. Humans are messy, complicated, and dumb. It's only by methodically testing and refining that designers can acheive exactly the play experience they wish their players to have. (as opposed to a painting or song perhaps, though those would benefit from iteration too). Control is big.

**Second-order design** -- the game developers create the game, but the player is the one who decides how, when, and why to play it. In mathematics and propositional logic, first-order logic is the insertion of variables into an equation, and second-order logic emerges from the interaction of those variables. So we set up the variables (the play elements), but we have almost no control over the interactions (save through our designs). Unexpected outcomes (actions, feelings, contexts) emerge when a player plays within the dynamic system of a game. 

**Space of possibility** -- the potential experiences a game designer creates through their combination of objects, playspace, players, rules, actions, and goals. (Queers in love at the end of the world or line wobbler VS minecraft). Shifts focus of responsibility for experience -- narrow space games are usually designed for a very specific experience the designer wants you to have, while huge open-world games leave the experience up to the player (mostly). Why play design is important -- designing games doesn't produce experiences, but designing games that produce play produces experiences (or something).

**Game state** refers to a snapshot moment of a game -- where the players and objects are in the playspace, the current score, the progress towards completing the game's goal, and so on. Sequence of states will always be similar but likely never the same -- why games are such a powerful medium, they allow for endless emergent experience. (**emergent experience** defined as meaning arising from choices).


## Chapter 2: Basic Game Design Tools

- Constraint
	- putting limits on player actions and interactions with the objects, other players, and the playspace with the intention of creating a play experience.
	- Rules make play more interesting and engaging, and make achieving the goal more satisfying.
	- Bernard Suits' "lusory attitude" -- players are willing to accept, and even invite, less efficient or logical means of engaging with a game in exchange for the potential of the play experience.
	- Generate challenge, creative strategies, and engagement for players.
	- examples
		- golf -- why not just put ball in hole? why expensive stick far from hole?
		- octodad -- game about mopping the floor as a human, not fun. game about trying to mop the floor as a boneless octopus, fun.
	- Direct and Indirect Action
		- Direct actions are those in which the player has immediate interaction with objects and the playspace
		- Indirect actions are those that occur without direct contact by the player or the primary objects they use while playing
			- pinball chain of events
		- more direct actions = more agency, more indirect actions = more discovery and immersion, balance of the two = dynamic, interactive world
	- Goals
		- balance between goals, no goals, and goals as means for process (catalyst that allows the experience to unfold, humans like direction, later the experience can be the drive)
		- *Dog Eat Dog* -- colonization RPG 
		- layered goals -- goals within goals or goals that are really masks for a deeper goal (i.e. perform this task to learn more of the story)
		- goals are very important, they are one of the only ways we can guide players' experiences in engaging with the actions, objects, and playspaces we design.
		- Goals frame the play experience and suggest to players how to engage with the game. They shape the space of possibility.
		- They also shape how players perceive the available actions and objects and whether they approach them as a means to an end or an experience unto themselves.
	- Challenge
		- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's idea of flow -- balance of challenge and skill that results in high focus and enjoyment
			- reference for how to design increasing difficulty in a game
		- similar concept is absorption, deep engagement in the play experience.
			- can result in over-coming self-consciousness, as in Ninja
		- also used to encourage player skill development
		- can be a challenge of skill, or a more abstract challenge, like a game that challenges notions of gender for example
		- "Perfect Woman" kinect game as example of all three
		- challenge is a dial you can tune up or down
	- Skill, Strategy, Chance, Uncertainty
		- Skill -- the degree to which a player has mastered an action within a game
		- Strategy -- the ability of the player to determine the best ways to perform the actions of the game in order to achieve their goals
		- chance -- 
			- the more chance, the harder it is for a player to develop strategies, regardless of skill
			- poker and other games where you develop strategies around chance
		- uncertainty -- 
			- no matter how much one practices, there is uncertainty that can lead to unpredictable events in a game.
			- how much is directed by players vs outside of their control? (chess vs roulette, chutes and ladders = all chance, no choice)
	- Decision Making and Feedback
		- "action-outcome unit" -- gameplay is made of hundreds of these pairs of decisions and results, each one creating a new game state, and overall creating the play experience itself.
		- the player needs time to analyze the game state in-order to made a decision, and then afterwards, the change in the game state must be obvious for the player to know what impact their choice has had.
			- can have delayed feedback, like in an engine builder or war game
		- can make games that prioritize experience over player control
		- the more clearly a game designer crafts the ability of players to understand the game state and the impact of their actions on it, the more chance players have to feel empowered in their play
	- Abstraction
		- how representational the game is
		- non-representational abstraction of game elements (go)
		- abstraction of real-world activities into other medium (pong)
		- abstraction of systems into game form (pandemic)
		- abstraction gets rid of extraneous details and lets game designers focus on what's fun about the interaction of the game goals, the actions players can take to reach those goals, and the objects and playspaces
	- Theme
		- the logical framework for how the game represents itself (?)
		- a conceptual handle for players to be able to grasp how the world might work, and a framework for them to use when interpreting how their decisions might effect the game state.
		- what is the game "about" -- both the conceptual framework and the experience that the players have within that framework. (i.e. a game where you struggle to communicate being about cooperation)
	- (Atmosphere) 
		- the sensory feel of the game and how that contributes to player experience and builds theme
		- aesthetics, sound, texture, juice, colors, speed, haziness, etc.
	- Storytelling
		- can be the main play experience (kentucky route zero)
		- can be a blank slate narrative that will be thematically similar to others' games, but arise uniquely out of the choices the player makes
		- emergent narrative
	- Context of Play
		- where is the game played and by whom?
		- can't always predict this as designers, but can limit the possible contexts by way of the physical materials needed to play the game

## Chapter 3: The Kinds of Play
- Not mutually exclusive, like ingredients in a meal
- Competitive Play
	- some players win, some players lose -- trying to come out ahead of your opponent
	- yomi -- Japanese concept for knowing the mind of your opponent, using your predictions about their actions to inform your actions.
		- when the interplay of a player's skill and strategies come up against the uncertainty of another player's skill and strategies.
	- can be local, asynchronous, vs the game
	- challenge of reaching the games goals, competing against the game and yourself
	- Symmetrical vs Asymmetrical competition
		- symmetrical competition -- players have the same abilities, shared actions, common goal
		- asymmetrical competition -- players have different abilities/actions/objects and a different goal
- Cooperative Play
	- players work together to achieve the game's goals
	- one of the best feelings, sync, flow
	- symmetrical
	- asymmetrical
	- symbiotic
		- players are reliant on one another to complete the game, it's impossible to win on your own
- Skill-Based Play
	- active skills
		- manual dexterity, eye-hand coordination -- ex. precise movement and timing
	- mental skills
		- solving puzzles, memory, probability, etc.
	- the higher the bar, the less players who are willing to commit but the greater the rewards for those who do (dark souls)
- Experience-Based Play
	- not focused on skill, but rather narrative, atmosphere, etc.
	- can also be a part of competitive games like ninja, where the experience of playing with the group is usually more important than winning
- Games of Chance and Uncertainty
	- strategic management of uncertainty -- too much uncertainty and players feel like their efforts are meaningless, too little and it's not exciting
	- card games like MTG and Netrunner -- shuffling decks is a core mechanic, would be a completely different game and play experience if you didn't have to shuffle your deck
	- the "spiciness" of a game -- too much and it's inedible, too little and it's bland
	- Candy land -- a game where there is no player choice at all. the illustrations and imaginative play and experience of rolling the dice are enough for four year olds, but not for others.
- Whimsical Play

4. Filter
	1. Questions to Ask
		1. Did your playtesting parameters produce insights in the sections you were hoping to get clarity on?
		2. What unexpected insights came up?
		3. What was the vibe of the players?
		4. Do you think your players understood the game? What was the average amount of time in unknown // learning // confused // off to the races // grokked?
		5. What are some ways to improve on the things you were testing, or other ways to test them?
		6. What aspects of the game would you test next?

## Misc
- Will have organic group formation -- ideas over arbitrary sizes. But a group of 4 people should look like it took 4 people to make. And at least one assignment must be done solo, and one assignment must be done in a group.
	- Could ask people if they prefer to work solo or in group. Nah too complicated, just across board.
- Could have a one-pager accompany each game assignment
	- Define the six elements of play for the game
- Can make a webpage autosorter for playtest time based on how many players each group needs
